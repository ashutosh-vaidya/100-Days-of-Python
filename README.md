# 100 Days of Python

This repo is created to keep all the project work done as a part of the Udemy course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/18085749#overview).  

Each day new project is built, so it will be 100 projects in 100 days with difficulty levels from beginner to expert. Every folder in this repo represents each day having a readme file describing the problem statement, instruction, and link to the solution provided by the instructor and the main python file containing my implementation of the problem statement.
